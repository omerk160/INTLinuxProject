Kernel System Calls
-------------------
first, f-stat is trying to get file info from a folder that doesnt exist, so the script make dir welcomeToDevOpsTheHardWay, open the file goodluck in repo folder, and writes in it "there you go tell me what I do"


Broken Symlink
-------------------
the symlink will be broken if moved to another folder. A fix is to delete the old symlink, than create a new symlink file that directs to backups folder



Binary Numbers
--------------
1.7,4,22
2.0-255
3.the left 9th digit represent posisive/negative num, while the 8 other bits represent the binary num as we know
4.this will be represented using 3 components - sign bit (1 bit), to check if the num is positive or negative. exponent (3 bits) - to convert the int num before the dot to binary, and finally to convernt the nums converted to binary after the dot.
    for example, 12.3 will be = 0 1010 100 ( 0-positive, 12= 1010 , 3= 100).
